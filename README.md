# Git Clone Plugin for Acode

## Overview

I have developed this plugin to allow you to clone a Git repository to your local machine using Lightning-FS and isomorphic-git. It also supports authentication for cloning private repositories.

## Features

- Clone Git repositories to your local machine
- Support for authentication for cloning private repositories
- Select the directory to clone the repository to from the available directories in your workspace

## Installation

To install the plugin, open Acode and go to Extensions > Manage Extensions. Search for "Git Clone" and click the Install button.

## Usage

1. To clone a Git repository, open Acode and go to File > Clone Git Repository.
2. Enter the URL of the repository you want to clone and click the Clone button.
3. If the repository is private, you will be prompted to enter your credentials.
4. Once the repository has been cloned, it will appear in the Workspace pane. You can then open the repository by double-clicking on it.

## Selecting the Clone Directory

To select the directory to clone the repository to, click the Select Directory button in the Clone Git Repository dialog box. A file picker will appear, allowing you to select the desired directory.

## Troubleshooting

If you are having problems cloning a repository, please check the following:

- Make sure that you have entered the correct URL for the repository.
- If the repository is private, make sure that you have entered the correct credentials.
- Ensure that you have enough disk space to clone the repository.

If you are still having problems, please create an issue on my plugin's GitHub repository.

## Contributions and Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the open-source communities behind [Lightning-FS](https://github.com/Medium/opensource) and [isomorphic-git](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git) for their incredible work in developing and maintaining these essential libraries. This plugin wouldn't be possible without their contributions.

## Feedback

If you have any feedback on the plugin, please feel free to leave a comment below or create an issue on my plugin's GitHub repository.

## Drawback

Currently, the plugin will block other operations because it doesn't use a web worker. This will be fixed in the next update.
